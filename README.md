ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @daskol. I'm a PhD student at [Skoltech][1] in Moscow. My primary
research interests lie in the area of natural language processing (NLP),
language models (LLMs), and machine learning in general.

Modern machine learning is very engineering-focused which suits me. I'm
interested in getting into the nitty-gritty and making things more efficient
and performant. Some of my projects are precisely aimed at that (e.g.
[lotr][2], [mpl-typst][3], [yax][4], and others).
